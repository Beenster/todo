    user feedback based on the outcome of various operations, such as
    adding a task, finding a task, or encountering an error. They
    enhance the user experience by offering clear, actionable
    information following commands.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Each **feedback\_** function is tailored to handle the output of a
    specific operation, formatting and printing messages to the
    terminal.

-   They may display success messages, error warnings, or detailed
    information about tasks or operations, depending on their context.

-   These functions are usually invoked with specific data resulting
    from operations (e.g., a newly added task\'s ID or a list of tasks
    not found), which they use to construct their output messages.\
    **18. safe_print(partial)**\
    Business Functionality: Ensures that output is correctly printed to
    the terminal, accounting for potential issues with character
    encoding or terminal capabilities. It improves robustness and user
    experience across different environments.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Attempts to print output using the preferred encoding and character
    set (e.g., UTF-8 with Unicode characters).

-   Catches **UnicodeEncodeError** exceptions, which may occur if the
    terminal does not support certain characters, and falls back to a
    safer, likely ASCII-only, representation.

-   This function is designed to wrap other printing functions,
    providing them with an abstraction layer that handles encoding
    issues transparently.\
    \
    **[.source/todo/cli_parser.py]{.underline}**\
    \
    **1. parse_id(tid_list)**\
    Business Functionality: Converts a list of task IDs from their
    hexadecimal string representation to integers, which are used
    internally by the application to reference tasks. This function
    supports operations that require task identification, such as
    editing or marking tasks as done.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Accepts either a single string or a list of strings representing
    task IDs.

-   Iterates over each ID, attempting to convert from hexadecimal to
    integer. If successful, the integer is added to a list of valid IDs;
    otherwise, it\'s added to a list of invalid IDs.

-   Returns a tuple indicating success (all IDs are valid) or failure
    (one or more IDs are invalid), along with the list of valid IDs or
    an error message.\
    **2. parse_context(ctx)**\
    Business Functionality: Normalizes context names for consistent
    processing and storage. Contexts categorize tasks, and this function
    ensures that context specifications by the user are uniformly
    handled.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Directly returns a boolean indicating successful parsing and the
    context name after processing it through
    **data_access.dbfy_context**, which likely formats or sanitizes the
    context string for database operations.\
    **3. parse_moment(moment, direction=1)**\
    Business Functionality: Parses temporal expressions provided by the
    user, converting them into standardized datetime formats. This
    function is essential for scheduling tasks with specific start times
    or deadlines.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Supports parsing both absolute dates (in various formats) and
    relative delays (e.g., \"2w\" for two weeks from now).

-   Uses **\_parse_datetime** for the heavy lifting, which tries to
    match the input string against known date formats or interprets it
    as a delay.

-   The **direction** parameter allows the function to interpret delays
    as either in the future (default) or in the past, adjusting the
    current time (**NOW**) accordingly.

-   Returns a tuple indicating success or failure, along with the parsed
    datetime in the application\'s standard format or an error message.\
    **4. parse_deadline(moment)**\

    deadlines, allowing for a special case where a deadline can be
    explicitly set to \"none\".\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Checks if the input string is \"none\" (case-insensitive),
    indicating no deadline. Returns a special value (\'None\') in such
    cases.

-   Otherwise, delegates to **parse_moment** for parsing the deadline as
    a datetime or delay.

-   Ensures compatibility with tasks that may not have a deadline.\
    **5. \_parse_datetime(string, now, direction=1)**\
    Business Functionality: Core utility for interpreting user-provided
    date and time strings, converting them into datetime objects based
    on the application\'s current time context.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Attempts to match the input string against several predefined date
    and time formats. If a match is found, it converts the string to a
    datetime object.

-   If the input matches a delay pattern (using **parse_period**),
    calculates the resulting datetime by applying the delay to **now**,
    adjusted by **direction**.

-   Handles both specific datetimes and relative delays, returning
    **None** if parsing fails, indicating that the input format was
    unrecognized.\
    **6. parse_period(string)**\
    Business Functionality: Translates a string representing a time
    period (e.g., \"2w\" for two weeks) into seconds. This function
    underpins features like recurring tasks or delay-based scheduling.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Uses a regular expression to identify and extract the numeric part
    and the unit of time (days, hours, etc.) from the input string.

-   Converts the extracted time period into seconds based on predefined
    constants in **REMAINING**.

-   Returns a tuple indicating success or failure, along with the period
    in seconds or an error message.\
    **7. parse_new_context_name(name)**\
    Business Functionality: Validates the new name for a context during
    a renaming operation, ensuring it adheres to application rules
    (e.g., no dots).\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Checks for the presence of a dot in the new name, returning an error
    if found, since dots are used to denote subcontexts.

-   Also checks for an attempt to rename the root context (empty name),
    which is not allowed.

-   Returns a tuple indicating success or failure, along with the new
    context name or an error message.\
    **8. parse_dependencies(dependencies)**\
    Business Functionality: Processes a list of task IDs that a task
    depends on, ensuring no duplicates and converting IDs from
    hexadecimal to integer.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Special case handling for \"nothing\" indicating no dependencies.

-   Uses a **Counter** to detect duplicate IDs, returning an error if
    duplicates are found.

-   Delegates to **parse_id** to convert IDs from hexadecimal to
    integer, ensuring they are in the correct format for internal use.\
    **9. parse_toggle(value)**\
    Business Functionality: Interprets a string value as a boolean,
    specifically for toggling task properties (e.g., marking a task to
    always show in todo listings).\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Maps string values \"true\", \"false\", and **None** to their
    respective boolean or **None** values, supporting features that can
    be enabled, disabled, or left as default.\
    **10. parse_args(args)**\
    Business Functionality: Central function for applying all argument
    parsers to the inputs provided by the user, facilitating the
    execution of commands based on validated and correctly formatted
    arguments.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Iterates through expected arguments, applying the relevant parser to
    each based on predefined **PARSERS**.

-   Accumulates any errors encountered during parsing for reporting back
    to the user, ensuring the application can gracefully handle
    incorrect inputs.\
    **11. parse_cli(), parse_bare_todo(argv), and parse_command(argv)**\
    Business Functionality: Entry points for parsing the command line,
    determining whether the user intends to execute a specific command
    or a general operation like listing tasks. They support the dynamic
    and flexible use of the CLI.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **parse_cli** checks if the command is a recognized operation or if
    it should handle a default listing case.

-   **parse_bare_todo** sets up parsing for operations without explicit
    commands, such as listing tasks in a context.

-   **parse_command** constructs an **argparse.ArgumentParser** for
    detailed command parsing, defining commands, subcommands, and their
    options, ensuring that user inputs are correctly interpreted and
    routed to the appropriate functionality.\
    \
    **[.source/todo/core.py]{.underline}**\
    \
    **1. editor_edit_task(title, content, editor)**\
    Business Functionality: This function facilitates the editing of a
    task\'s title and content by opening them in a user-specified text
    editor. It\'s used when a task needs to be modified or detailed
    further than what command-line input comfortably allows.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **init_content** is prepared by combining the title and content,
    with content wrapped according to preferences if specified.

-   **utils.input_from_editor(init_content, editor)** opens the default
    or specified text editor with the initial content loaded for
    editing. Once the user finishes editing, the modified content is
    captured.

-   **parse_task_full_content(full_content)** parses the edited content
    back into a title and content, handling cases where content may
    start immediately after the title or after a newline.

    smart_wrap=False)**\
    Business Functionality: Prepares the full text representation of a
    task for display or editing by combining the title and content. It
    supports optional word wrapping for better readability.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If **wrap_width** is provided, both the title and content are
    wrapped using the **text_wrap.wrap_text** function, which applies
    word wrapping and, if **smart_wrap** is enabled, more sophisticated
    formatting rules.

-   Constructs a string that combines the title and content, separated
    by a line of equals signs (**=**) matching the width of the title,
    which visually distinguishes the title from the content.\
    **3. parse_task_full_content(full_content)**\
    Business Functionality: Extracts the title and content from a single
    string, typically the result of editing a task in a text editor.
    This function is essential for processing user modifications to
    tasks.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Iterates through lines of **full_content**, distinguishing between
    the title and content based on formatting cues (e.g., lines starting
    with **\# **or a line of equals signs).

-   Accumulates title and content in separate variables, handling
    Markdown-style titles and the transition from title to content.

-   Trims trailing whitespace from the title to clean up formatting
    artifacts.\
    **4. do_recurring_task(task, daccess)**\
    Business Functionality: Handles the completion of a recurring task,
    determining if the task is currently due and updating its status
    accordingly. This function supports the recurring task feature by
    managing occurrences of tasks over time.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Determines the last and next occurrences of the task relative to the
    current time using **get_task_neighbourhood_occurrences(task)**.

-   Checks if the task was already completed in the current period by
    comparing the **last_done** timestamp against the last occurrence.

-   Updates the task\'s completion status for the current period by
    calling **daccess.add_done_occurrence(task\[\'id\'\])** if it\'s
    due.

-   Constructs a report indicating the outcome of the operation,
    including whether the task\'s current period has already been marked
    as completed.\
    **5. get_task_neighbourhood_occurrences(task: dict)**\
    Business Functionality: Calculates the time windows for recurring
    tasks, specifically identifying the last and next occurrences of a
    task based on its start time and recurrence period. This is crucial

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Converts the task\'s start time from a string to a **datetime**
    object.

-   Calls **get_neighbourhood_occurrences(start, task\[\'period\'\])**
    to calculate the last and next occurrences relative to the current
    time.\
    **6. get_neighbourhood_occurrences(start: datetime, period: int)**\
    Business Functionality: Given a start time and a period, calculates
    when the given period last occurred and when it will next occur
    relative to the current time. This function underpins the scheduling
    logic for recurring tasks.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Iteratively adds the period to the start time until the next
    occurrence is in the future relative to the current time (**now**).

-   Returns both the last occurrence (immediately before **now**) and
    the next occurrence (immediately after **now**).\
    **7. current_period_is_done(task: dict)**\
    Business Functionality: Determines whether a recurring task has been
    completed in its current period. This is used to decide if a
    recurring task should be shown as due or not.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Checks if the task is recurring and whether it has been marked as
    done at least once.

-   If so, compares the task\'s **last_done** timestamp to the last
    occurrence time to ascertain if the task has been completed in the
    current period.

-   Returns **True** if the task is done for the current period,
    otherwise **False**.\

    **[.source/todo/data_access.py]{.underline}**\
    \
    **1. setup_data_access(current_version)**\
    Business Functionality: Prepares the database for use by the
    application, ensuring it is up-to-date and compatible with the
    application\'s current version. This includes creating the database
    if it doesn\'t exist, applying migrations, or converting data from
    older formats (e.g., JSON).\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Checks for the existence of the data directory; if not found, it\'s
    created.

-   Calls **init_db.update_database** to apply any necessary database
    migrations based on the current version.

-   If the current version indicates data in an old JSON format, it
    loads this data and calls **transfer_data** to move it into the
    SQLite database.\
    **2. transfer_data(connection, data)**\
    Business Functionality: Converts tasks and contexts from a JSON
    format into the SQLite database format. This function supports
    backward compatibility with older versions of the application that
    used JSON for data storage.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Iterates over contexts and tasks in the provided JSON data.

-   For each context, it ensures it exists in the database, creating it
    if necessary, and applies any relevant properties (e.g., priority,
    visibility).

-   For each task, it creates a new task record in the database with
    appropriate properties and associates it with the correct context.\
    **3. dbfy_context(ctx) and userify_context(ctx)**\
    Business Functionality: These functions convert between the
    user-friendly representation of context paths and the database
    representation. Context paths in the database start with a dot for
    non-root contexts, which is not required when entered by the user.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **dbfy_context** adds a leading dot to the context path if it
    doesn\'t already start with one unless the path is empty (root
    context).

-   **userify_context** removes the leading dot from the database
    context path for display to the user.\
    **4. iso2sqlite(iso_date)**\
    Business Functionality: Converts a date in ISO format to the SQLite
    datetime format. This is used when transferring data from JSON to

    components for insert and update operations, respectively. They are
    used to dynamically construct SQL queries based on variable sets of
    task or context properties.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **get_insert_components** generates column names, placeholders, and
    values for an INSERT query.

-   **get_update_components** generates placeholders and values for an
    UPDATE query, formatting each option as **column_name=?**.\
    **6. check_options(options, allowed_options)**\
    Business Functionality: Validates that the options provided for
    tasks or contexts are allowed, preventing invalid property names
    from being used in database operations.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Iterates through each option, checking if it\'s in the list of
    allowed options. Raises a **ValueError** if an illegal option is
    found.\
    **7. DataAccess class**\
    Business Functionality: Encapsulates all database interactions,
    providing a method-based interface for operations like adding,
    updating, and deleting tasks and contexts, managing recurring tasks,
    and querying tasks and contexts based on various criteria.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Methods like **add_task**, **update_task**, **task_exists**,
    **get_task**, and **set_task_dependencies** perform specific
    operations on tasks, utilizing SQL queries to interact with the
    database.

-   Context-related methods like **get_or_create_context**,
    **context_exists**, **set_context**, and **rename_context** manage
    context records in the database.

-   The class also includes methods for handling recurring tasks
    (**get_last_occurrence_done**, **add_done_occurrence**) and for
    locking tasks for editing to prevent concurrent modifications.

-   Utility methods (**get_insert_components**,
    **get_update_components**, **check_options**, etc.) support the
    construction and validation of SQL queries.

-   Special decorator **\@return_row_task** is used to deserialize task
    records from the database into a more convenient format for the
    application to use.\
    This module is fundamental for the persistence layer of the
    application, abstracting the complexity of direct database
    operations and providing a clean interface for the rest of the
    application to interact with stored data.\
    \
    **[.source/todo/types.py]{.underline}**\
    **DoTaskReportType Enum**\
    Business Functionality: This enumeration defines the possible
    outcomes of attempting to mark a task as done within the
    application. It serves as a standardized way to communicate the
    result of such operations, whether successful, unnecessary (e.g.,
    task not found or already done), or specific scenarios like handling
    recurring tasks.\
    **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Inherits from **Enum**, a base class for creating enumerations which
    are a set of symbolic names bound to unique, constant values.

    -   Defines four members to represent the outcomes of task
        operations:

    -   **OK**: The operation completed successfully.

    -   **NOT_FOUND**: The specified task could not be found.

    -   **ALREADY_DONE**: The task is already marked as done and does
        not need to be marked again.

    -   **RECURRENCE_ALREADY_DONE**: For recurring tasks, indicates that
        the current occurrence of the task has already been completed.\
        **DoTasksReport TypedDict**\
        Business Functionality: This Typed Dictionary specifies the
        structure of a report object that details the result of an
        operation to mark tasks as done. It is used to communicate not
        just the outcome (via **DoTaskReportType**) but also includes
        the task identifier and, optionally, the next occurrence date
        for recurring tasks.\
        **Technical Implementation**:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Inherits from **TypedDict**, which allows for the creation of
    dictionaries with expected types for each key.

    -   Specifies three keys:

    -   **task_id**: A string representing the unique identifier of the
        task involved in the operation. This ID facilitates tracking and
        referencing the specific task across the application.

    -   **report_type**: Uses the **DoTaskReportType** enumeration to
        indicate the result of the operation, providing a clear, typed
        status that can be programmatically checked and responded to.

    -   **next_occurrence_datetime**: An optional string that, when
        present, indicates the next scheduled occurrence of a recurring
        task. This field is particularly useful for applications that
        need to inform users about when a recurring task will become
        active again.\
        \
        **[.source/todo/utils.py]{.underline}**\
        \
        **Constants for Paths and Filenames**

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   DATA_DIR_NAME, DATAFILE_NAME, DATABASE_NAME, DATA_CTX_NAME,
        VER_FILE_NAME:

    -   **Business Functionality**: Define standard names for the
        application\'s data storage, including the main data directory,
        database file, JSON data file for legacy support, context
        information for auto-completion, and version tracking.

    -   **Technical Implementation**: Constants are defined for the
        names of these components. The data directory\'s location is
        determined dynamically, prioritizing a local directory over a
        user\'s home directory.\
        **Date and Time Formats**

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   ISO_SHORT, SQLITE_DT_FORMAT:

    -   **Business Functionality**: Standardize date formats used
        throughout the application for user interfaces and database
        storage, ensuring consistency in date handling.

    -   **Technical Implementation**: Strings defining date format
        patterns according to Python\'s **datetime** module conventions,
        facilitating parsing and formatting operations.\
        **Dynamic Table Printing**

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   print_table(struct, iterable, is_default=lambda obj, p: False):

    -   **Business Functionality**: Provides a flexible way to print
        tabulated data to the terminal, supporting variable column
        widths, alignments, and custom rendering logic. This is crucial
        for displaying lists of tasks, contexts, and other tabular data
        in a user-friendly manner.

    -   **Technical Implementation**: Utilizes a structured definition
        of columns and iterates over data to construct a formatted table
        string, which is then printed to the terminal. The function
        dynamically adjusts column widths based on the terminal size and
        supports custom rendering for specific fields.\
        **Text Editing via External Editor**

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    -   input_from_editor(init_content, editor):

    -   **Business Functionality**: Allows users to input or edit
        extensive text content (e.g., task descriptions) in their
        preferred text editor, enhancing usability for tasks that
        involve detailed text entry.

    -   **Technical Implementation**: Creates a temporary file
        pre-filled with initial content, opens it in the specified text
        editor, waits for the user to finish editing, and then reads
        back the modified content. This process involves handling
        temporary files and invoking external processes.\
        **Utility Functions**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   limit_str(string, length):

    -   **Business Functionality**: Truncates strings to a specified
        length for display purposes, ensuring that output fits within
        the terminal\'s width without breaking layout constraints.

    -   **Technical Implementation**: Shortens a string to a maximum
        length, appending ellipses if necessary, with special handling
        for very short limits.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **parse_remaining(delta)**:

    -   **Business Functionality**: Converts time differences into a
        human-readable format, useful for displaying how much time is
        left until a task\'s deadline or how long ago something
        occurred.

    -   **Technical Implementation**: Translates a **timedelta** object
        into a string describing the time in the largest relevant unit
        (days, hours, minutes, seconds), including handling of negative
        deltas for past events.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **get_highlights_term(string, term, str_color, case=False)**:

    -   **Business Functionality**: Highlights occurrences of a search
        term within strings, improving the visibility of search results
        and other keyword-based features in the application.

    -   **Technical Implementation**: Uses regular expressions to find
        occurrences of the term within the string, optionally applying
        ANSI color codes for terminal highlighting, with support for
        case-sensitive or insensitive matching.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **compare_versions(vA, vB)** and **parse_version(v)**:

    -   **Business Functionality**: Facilitate version comparison and
        parsing to manage application updates, feature gating, or
        compatibility checks based on version numbers.

    -   **Technical Implementation**: **compare_versions** compares two
        version strings based on semantic versioning rules, while
        **parse_version** breaks down a version string into its
        constituent parts (major, minor, patch, pre-release) for
        detailed comparison.
